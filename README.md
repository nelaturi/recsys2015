# recsys2015
This repo contains a parser written in Java which consumes the YOOCHOOSE data set used for the RecSys 2015 challenge and outputs it into the [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki) file format.

See [this post](http://humphreysheil.com/blog/a-quick-run-through-vowpal-wabbit) for more details and how Vowpal does on the challenge problem.
